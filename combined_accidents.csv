The crash happened on the Mdina road at around 9pm when the car driven by Alejandro Brincat jumped the crash barrers and smashed into a tree and signpost. The 25-year-old's death triggered an outpouring of grief from friends and family, with many expressing sorrow for the loss of a father of two young girls.  A midfielder with Vittoriosa Stars, several football clubs and associations in the local football community took to social media to express their sorrow at Brincat's death.  His club said they were “heartbroken” at his passing.  “Alejandro was a true gentleman and a very respected player within the team. Our number #99 will be deeply missed by all of us and also for sure by those who knew him,” Vittoriosa Stars said in a post on social media.  “Our thoughts and prayers are with his family during this difficult time. May he rest in peace.”   Lawyer Robert Thake said that while many were remembering Brincat for his success on the football pitch, little was being said about what a dedicated father he was.  ""Alejandro fought like hell - but with dignity - to spend as much time as he could with his daughter, and after over two years of fighting in court he finally got to spend Christmas Day with his daughter,"" he said.  He is survived by his daughters Ella and Kyra.",21:00,2025-01-06,death,driver,0,0,0,1,0,0,FXOBJ,['25'],Attard on Monday night,Attard on Monday night,,0,0,False,False,15.9,12.4,18.1,0.0,False,crushed into an obstacle

The truck, the NGO said, ended up within the bicycle lane, where, had there been a bicycle user, they could have been fatally injured. ""The current road design offers no protection for cyclists, and this tragic event highlights the pressing need for proper segregation between high-speed traffic and vulnerable road users, particularly those on bicycles,"" ROTA said. The need for protected bicycle lanes is not just a local issue - the matter has also been flagged in international road safety guidelines such as the CROW guidelines. These guidelines emphasise the importance of segregation in high-speed areas and the need for roads that are forgiving of human error, the group noted. ""In simple terms, we must ensure that the consequences of mistakes – whether made by a driver or a cyclist – are not fatal. Sadly, Malta is still without a legally binding national cycling policy that will outline clear standards for the design and implementation of safe and effective bicycle lanes. ""We cannot allow cyclists to be subjected to what is, at best, a makeshift effort that often amounts to nothing more than a splash of green paint and some rumble strips. It is not enough. Bicycle lanes need to be designed to protect cyclists – physically separated from traffic in high-speed areas, with sufficient space and barriers to prevent accidents.""",10:00,2025-03-14,grievous,cyclist,0,0,0,1,1,0,ROLL,['35'],Friday morning,Friday morning,,4,1,False,False,18.6,14.9,21.7,0.0,False,overturned

2025-07-20,"A scooter rider injured in a hit-and-run crash in the Regional Road tunnels earlier this month is struggling to track down the driver, after being told that none of the tunnel cameras work. Giuseppe Di Dio, a 22-year-old Sicilian who works as a DJ and event organiser, was riding his Vespa 300 on July 2 at around 12.30pm when he was hit. As he entered the tunnel heading towards Swieqi, he says a van crossed into his lane, cut him off and crashed into him, knocking him off his Vespa. “I feel super lucky to tell the story. It hurt a lot. When I was on the floor, I could feel my burns,” he told Times of Malta. Shocked by the impact, Di Dio said he could not identify the van but recalled opening his eyes to see the driver standing over him. According to Di Dio, the man looked South Asian and was wearing a blue shirt. He believes he was driving a delivery van but is unsure which company the van belonged to. “He came over, checked I was alive, told me nothing and rushed off,” he said. “I know if I saw him, I would recognise him.” Thankfully, other drivers stopped to help Di Dio. He was taken to Mater Dei Hospital, where he said he had to wait between six to seven hours before being seen. “That was horrible. I couldn’t take it anymore and began to scream out in pain, and only then did they see me,” he said. He was initially told he had minor injuries and was prescribed painkillers. But after several days, his wounds became increasingly painful and doctors at Saint James Hospital later confirmed they were infected. Alongside the physical injuries, Di Dio said his motorbike was damaged and he incurred around €4,000 in expenses for medical treatment, medications, transport and missed work. “I want a refund for the damages but the most important thing is I want to find out who hit me to avoid future accidents,” he said.  After being treated, Di Dio filed a police report. He hoped CCTV footage from the tunnel would help identify the van. But he said police informed him that the security cameras inside the Ta’ Giorni tunnels do not work. “It’s insane. The policeman told me that none of the cameras they have for the tunnels work,” he said. “I told them that it is impossible but they told me again that none of them work.” In 2020, the government launched a €10 million project to upgrade Malta’s major tunnels, including Ta’ Giorni, which included the installation of security cameras. When asked if the cameras were working on the day of the incident, the transport ministry said: “The Traffic Control Centre did not have CCTV coverage in the mentioned area on the 2nd of July 2025.” The ministry did not answer questions about whether the cameras are operational. Police confirmed that a report on the accident had been filed and investigations are ongoing. In 2022, a Transport Malta spokesperson told Times of Malta that tunnel cameras were linked to the authority’s traffic control centre, and used for both congestion monitoring and automatic incident detection.",12:30,2025-07-20,minor,pedestrian,0,1,0,1,0,0,PED,['22'],July 2 at around 12,July 2 at around 12,,6,0,False,False,27.7,23.7,33.2,0.0,False,running over pedestrian

2025-08-03,"Six people were killed between July 23 and 29, marking the deadliest week on Malta’s roads in at least 25 years, a toll that one expert says is a result of chronic failure to prioritise safety in road design. Data compiled by transport activist Paolo Cassar Manghi shows that no other seven-day period since at least 2000 has recorded so many road deaths. Cassar Manghi, a transport researcher and road safety advocate, described the spike in fatalities as “tragic but not surprising”, warning that the country’s road infrastructure often encourages speed rather than discouraging risk. Among the six victims were a driving instructor crushed by a runaway bus, a motorcyclist and a pedestrian killed in a crash involving a parked car. On the same week, three others were killed in unrelated violent incidents, in one of the bloodiest weeks in Malta on record. On July 23, a 79-year-old woman from Mosta died after the Renault van she was a passenger in crashed with a Suzuki Swift car in Lija. Three days later, Tenyo Kosev died when his Honda motorcycle was involved in a collision with a BMW 1 Series motorcycle in Pembroke at around 1am. Last Sunday, three people died. Mildred Azzopardi was crushed to death after a vehicle ploughed into a parked car, fatally hitting the 62-year-old. Azzopardi’s husband, Alfred, was critically injured. Benjamin Chetcuti, who was driving the car that hit the Azzopardis, is facing charges of manslaughter and driving under the influence of alcohol. The other two victims were a motorcyclist and a car passenger who was involved in a collision with a car driven by former president George Abela with his wife Margaret in the passenger seat.  Transport Minister Chris Bonett, however, has insisted that the police unit is not a replacement for the bureau and the two bodies will work together. “Two types of investigation are carried out: to establish what led to an accident, and second, to see what happens next... the idea is to work together,” he said in June. Bonett later clarified that the bureau’s main task will be to analyse how to make roads safer and recommend changes.

He told me that, after three or four months, he would be back,” she said. The middle child of three siblings, Khim moved to Malta over three years ago to work as a courier.

'Anger and frustration' She described how the family was filled with “anger and frustration” over the loss of Khim, who she described as a “vibrant soul” taken away too soon.  “The circumstances surrounding Khim’s death are unacceptable. This was not an accident; it was a reckless act that resulted in the loss of a precious life. We demand justice for Khim,” she said, highlighting how the driver must be held accountable for their actions. She said Khim’s wife was informed about her husband’s death by his brother’s wife. “She fainted when told and has not stopped crying since,” Nardevi said. She said Khim’s eldest son, who is 14, knows about his father’s death. His younger son, eight, and his six-year-old daughter still do not know. Khim’s sister described him as an honest and hard-working man. “He was a good person and always looked out for others in our community. He was always ready to help someone in need,” she explained. “My family and I are so sad and upset as we lost a huge pillar of our family.” When the family found out the circumstances around Khim’s death, she said the family began to question law and order in Malta. “We want justice for Khim and his family.

2025-09-18,"A man accused of murdering a driver after a minor road collision has been charged with a second alleged road rage incident that took place months before the fatal shooting. Mohamed Hamdan, 46, appeared in court yesterday to face a string of driving offences  over a January incident in St Paul’s Bay, in which he allegedly rammed his truck into a car following a traffic dispute. The incident, caught on camera and exclusively revealed by Times of Malta, involved Hamdan allegedly attempting to park his truck to make a water delivery to a hotel. Police inspector Warren Galea told the court that the alleged victim, driving a red Mazda, had overtaken Hamdan and blocked his access to the designated delivery spot on Triq it-Turisti.   The two men exited their vehicles and initially exchanged words. The situation quickly escalated, and a passenger had to intervene to separate them. Hamdan then returned to his truck and drove into the Mazda, which was later declared a total loss. Three other parked vehicles were also extensively damaged. The court heard that the accused was arrested at the time but released on police bail until February 26, pending the submission of medical documentation by the alleged victim. Despite repeated visits by Hamdan to the Qawra police station to seek updates, the requested documents were not submitted until March. The alleged victim presented a medical certificate and vehicle damage valuation report, both dated January. Hamdan also sustained a scratch, which was certified as slight injuries. Hamdan was called back to the police station on April 15. He requested to have his lawyer, Nicholas Mifsud, present before any interrogation. However, inspector Galea explained that due to Mifsud’s involvement in a high-profile jury case, the interview was postponed. Before a new date could be set, the fatal Bidnija shooting occurred. Hamdan was arrested and charged with murdering Jean Paul Busuttil in yet another traffic dispute. Given the circumstances, police decided to file the earlier road rage charges on July 4 without conducting a formal interrogation. Hamdan pleaded not guilty to wilful damage to a car, slightly injuring the driver, damaging three parked cars through negligent and reckless driving, dangerous driving and recidivism. The alleged victim took the stand yesterday. Cautioned that he could face charges himself, the man chose to testify. He said he had been collecting employees from the Buġibba Hotel at around 6.30am when Hamdan’s truck reversed towards him. He claimed he tried to manoeuvre around the truck, asking Hamdan to let him pass so the latter could park. The witness described Hamdan exiting the truck and allegedly swearing and trying to punch him. He said his employees stepped in to defuse the situation, and as he returned to close the back passenger door, Hamdan drove his truck into his car and then several others. Under cross-examination, the alleged victim admitted that his car was in the middle of the road but insisted he had no alternative route to where he was going. He denied pushing Hamdan but admitted to “blocking” him when the accused attempted to strike him. Lawyer Jacob Magri, representing the alleged victim as parte civile, requested a protection order following the testimony. The court, presided over by Magistrate Leonard Caruana, is expected to rule on the matter from chambers. The case continues in October. Police inspector Warren Galea prosecuted. Lawyer Nicholas Mifsud assisted Hamdan.

The four were good friends and all lived in Swieqi.  Autopsy results could help shed light on the dynamics of the crash, with Croatian media having reported that the initial suspicion is that the person driving the vehicle may have become ill while driving, leading to the crash.   Jeremy Gambin was a basketball coach at Luxol and a former player who represented Malta at the 1987 Games of Small States of Europe in Monaco.

He previously worked for Air Malta in the airline's finance, flight ops and engineering departments. He and his wife Alexandra had two children and various grandchildren.   Sources told Times of Malta that family members were travelling to Croatia on Saturday, and forensics will continue with the autopsy.  The accident happened at 4.20pm on Thursday, on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj.

2025-10-07,"A crowdfunding campaign for a nurse left in a coma after a car crash that killed her unborn baby has raised more than €70,000 in two days. Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.",08:00,2025-10-07,death,pedestrian,0,0,0,1,0,0,FXOBJ,['34'],Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16,Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16,,1,1,False,False,20.8,18.7,23.3,0.0,False,crushed into an obstacle
2025-10-08,"The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: ""Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends."" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. ""He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,"" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.",09:30,2025-10-08,minor,driver,0,0,0,1,0,0,FXOBJ,[],Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday,Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday,,2,1,False,False,21.0,18.0,24.0,0.0,False,crushed into an obstacle
