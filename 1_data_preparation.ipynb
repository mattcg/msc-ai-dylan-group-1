       "      <td>A motorist claims his car mirror was shattered by a speeding LESA vehicle that failed to stop after hitting his car while he was stuck in traffic. Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>The PN on Monday slammed the government for diverting EU funds that were meant to be used to electrify Malta’s public transport to fund subsidies for electric private cars. By encouraging the use of private cars, the government would make the traffic situation on the island even worse, three party spokespeople told a press conference at the Marsa park-and-ride on Monday. Last week, the PN revealed that the government had \"secretly\" withdrawn plans to receive over €40 million in EU funding to spend on updating Malta’s bus fleet. As a result, the private company that runs the public transport system said its plans to electrify Malta’s bus fleet “cannot go ahead”. In reply to questions by Times of Malta, Prime Minister Robert Abela confirmed the funds that were going to be used for the project will instead go to people to electrify their private cars. But for the PN, switching diesel-powered buses to electric ones would have been a crucial initiative to reduce emissions and combat climate change. \"Since these buses operate throughout the day on our roads, they should be the first priority in the electrification of Malta's vehicle fleet. \"Instead, Robert Abela made the meaningless decision to withdraw the allocation of these funds, leaving diesel buses on the roads while redirecting funds to more private cars, worsening traffic. This comes after the government reduced the grant for private electric cars in the recent budget from €11,000 to €8,000.\" Spokespeople Mark Anthony Sammut, Ryan Callus, and Eve Borg Bonello told the media on Monday that the decision to withdraw from the €34 million agreement with the European Commission would also result in the loss of €7 million in EU funds for charging stations and another €50 million in private investment for cleaner air. \"This reckless decision by Abela confirms his lack of direction and how quality is discarded with every decision he makes. \"If he really needed to cut funds, Abela should have reduced wasteful spending on core government insiders and the corruption that has engulfed his administration,\" they said, adding that quality of life depended on clean air. They added that due to PL's incompetence, people's health will continue to suffer from the exhaust fumes of diesel-powered buses passing past pedestrians. \"The PN is the only solution for the Maltese people. We promise electrified mass transport that will not only reduce emissions on our roads but also provide an efficient and adequate service. \"Above all, we promise accountability and seriousness in public spending and in the use of European funds in the interest of the common good, not just for the privileged few.\" PL reacts Reacting to the PN's press conference, the PL said in a statement the Opposition's true colours were revealed on Monday morning. \"Under a Nationalist government, the thousands of grants given for a person to switch from traditional fuel to electrification of a vehicle will no longer be given,\" the PL claimed. The party said that a Labour government will, on the other hand, continue providing incentives to those who opt for an electric vehicle. The incentives will not just apply to the purchase of a car but also when it comes to the registration and circulation tax relief from the road licence. \"Strong initiatives for those who make the choice to go for a private vehicle, with the least possible environmental damage.\" That is the difference between austerity measures and incentivising people.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A private contractor who placed a skip on St Paul's Bay bypass that was involved in a serious road accident on Wednesday did not have a permit, local authorities say.  The mayor of St Paul’s Bay, Infrastructure Malta, and Transport Malta all said they did not grant permission for the unnamed contractor to place a skip on the road on Wednesday.  A 54-year-old motorcyclist was seriously injured when he crashed into the stationary garbage skip left on a blind bend along the bypass.  Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.</td>\n",

The first incident occurred in Mellieħa at around 5.30pm, when the 17-year-old was hit by a Jeep Grand Cherokee on Triq il-Marfa. The Jeep, driven by a 52-year-old Żejtun man, smashed into a parked Honda Civic as a result of the incident. The teenage victim was given first aid on site and rushed to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance to be treated for her serious injuries. Two hours later, police were busy responding to another serious incident in Gudja. A man was fixing a punctured tyre on a Ford Fiesta that stopped on Dawret il-Gudja at around 7.45pm when he was hit by a Skoda Fabia driven by a 50-year-old Gudja resident. The victim, a 29-year-old from Birżebbuġa, ended up squashed between the two vehicles and was seriously injured as a result. He was given first aid and taken to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance, where he is receiving treatment. Magistrate Ian Farrugia is leading two separate inquiries into the two traffic incidents.

The sixth and final steel piece measures 18 metres in length and weighs around 25.5 tonnes. “The flyover will allow us to create a new open space in the heart of Msida, while we will also be constructing a canal to help alleviate the flooding problem that is synonymous with this area,” Bonett said.  The Transport Minister said the project progressed at a fast pace, adding that a new bridge connecting Msida to Pietà will open to traffic in the coming weeks. Infrastructure Malta CEO Steve Ellul explained that the works on this project are being carried out in a way that minimises inconvenience as much as possible — both for residents and for those who travel through the area by car. “Major works that require traffic diversions are being carried out during weekends or at night, with clear communication in advance to ensure the project’s successful implementation,” Ellul said.</td>\n",

When coupled with mentions of 'illegal immigration', the issue ranks among the top concerns for people both on a national and individual level, cutting across party lines.  Concerns about corruption, which in previous years were regularly cited as a major national issue, appear to have waned and people are now more likely to cite the environment as a major issue  Senior citizens, on the other hand, appear to be the most satisfied citizens of all: 22.1 per cent were unable to name a single biggest problem impacting their life at the moment.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A court has sharply criticised the police and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not working together to properly establish the facts which led to the death of young worker Matthew Bartolo in the accident at Constructure Furniture 10 years ago. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit made her comments as Construct Furniture director John Agius, floor manager Amanda Cefai and foreman James Cefai were acquitted of involuntary homicide. Agius was convicted of having engaged Bartolo without undertaking a risk assessment and fined €7,000.  All the accused were acquitted of failing to keep proper records, perjury, suppressing the evidence of a crime, and providing false information to the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA). Agius was also acquitted of recidivism.  The court in its considerations said that the prosecution in such cases needed to prove that there was a link between an alleged shortcoming by the accused and the employee, and that their acts of commission or omission caused the fatal incident. While Agius was the director of the company which engaged Bartolo on January 12, 2025, there was no evidence that Bartolo was employed by the Cefais. All that transpired from the evidence was that they were both at the factory when the fatal incident occurred. A court-appointed expert had reported that the machine did not have any issues. In its judgement, the court said it did not understand how the prosecution did not consider the conclusions of the court-appointed expert, and did not take criminal action against Nick Bellizzi, the engineer who certified the machine in 2012, and who should have carried out a risk assessment of the full machine.  It was clear that Bellizzi was responsible for the health and safety of the machinery, with the prosecution having failed to show whether Construct Furniture had a health and safety officer. From the evidence it emerged that Agius was working on the basis of instructions issued by Bellizzi. Had there been any shortcomings, the accused was not alerted to them by the engineer.  The court also noted that Agius had installed a safety barrier to the machine out of his own will, showing that he was “serious” in his work, contrary to Bellizzi.  It therefore acquitted all three accused of the main charge of involuntary homicide. It also acquitted the Cefais of the charges related to health and safety, finding that there was no contractual link between them and the victim. With regards to Agius, the court said the situation was different since there was an employment contract. While Agius made use of Bellizzi’s services, he was not exonerated from his own duties. During the proceedings no documents were presented to show that Bartolo had undergone medical tests before being employed. It also emerged that the instructions on how to use the machine were not observed prior to the incident, with the court referring to the conclusions of a technical expert. In his testimony, Agius had said that Bartolo could have sought to place the wood on the machine in a better manner. Instead of stopping the machine altogether, he had jumped over the barrier and slipped.  On the basis of the available instructions to workers, the court ruled that Agius had done his utmost to ensure a safe working environment. Blundell should have been answerable to the shortcomings and not Agius, the court said. Agius was found guilty of employing Bartolo without a prior risk assessment  and without ensuring that he was assigned adequate work. The trio were acquitted of forging Bartolo’s signature on the employment contract, with the court noting that the court-appointed expert was never asked to carry out a comparative exercise on Bartolo’s signatures. Nor had the prosecution proven that the accused were making use of a fake employment contract. Agius was also not found guilty of recidivism after the prosecution did not present the judgement by which he had been found guilty earlier. This was the second prosecution in connection with the case. In 2023 David Peter Blundell, 50, who had been working alongside the 17-year old, was acquitted of failing to take all necessary health and safety measures during the operation of the machine. He was cleared of responsibility for the death. The court in its latest sentence rapped the prosecution and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not having worked together in the investigations of this case to establish what happened that led to Bartolo’s death. Despite so many years having passed, the court said it still did not have a clear picture of the unfortunate accident that led to the loss of life of someone just started out in life. “This court hopes that nowadays the two entities are working effectively together and for the benefit of society,” the court said. Agius was fined €7,000 and acquitted of the other charges. The Cefais were acquitted of all the charges. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit presided. Police superintendent Hubert Cini and inspector Joseph Mercieca prosecuted. Lawyers Veronique Dalli, Edward Gatt and Pio Valletta appeared for the accused. Lawyer Jason Azzopard, Kris Busietta and Alessandro Farrugia appeared for Bartolo’s family. Family members disappointed and frustrated Following the court's decisions members of the victim's family expressed frustration and disappointment by the outcome.   They said the outcome was unfair and much more could have been done int he 10 years since the tragedy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A man was acquitted on Wednesday morning in connection with the poolside brawl at Seabank Hotel. British tourist, Liam Joseph Stacey, was charged in July accused of causing grievous bodily harm during a brawl involving a group of allegedly drunk and aggressive Maltese patrons at the hotel. During the proceedings, it had emerged that the scene unfolded after Stacey was slapped in the face by one of the Maltese men, causing him to fall over his toddler. Stacey got up and allegedly punched the man, later identified as Roderick Sciortino, in retaliation.  The only visible mark was a small bruise on the back of Sciortino’s head, which was unrelated to the brain bleed and likely sustained when he fell. A consultant neurosurgeon confirmed that scans revealed a ruptured aneurysm -  a weakened arterial wall - that was not trauma-related. “It was a purely pathological bleed, not due to an injury,” Scerri said. He added that Sciortino’s blood pressure was recorded at 200, high enough to rupture an artery, and his alcohol levels were elevated. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech presided. The prosecution was led by AG lawyer Brandon Bonnici, assisted by police inspectors Bradley Grima and Clayton Camilleri. Lawyer Stefano Filletti assisted the accused.

Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"  \n",

By encouraging the use of private cars, the government would make the traffic situation on the island even worse, three party spokespeople told a press conference at the Marsa park-and-ride on Monday. Last week, the PN revealed that the government had \"secretly\" withdrawn plans to receive over €40 million in EU funding to spend on updating Malta’s bus fleet. As a result, the private company that runs the public transport system said its plans to electrify Malta’s bus fleet “cannot go ahead”. In reply to questions by Times of Malta, Prime Minister Robert Abela confirmed the funds that were going to be used for the project will instead go to people to electrify their private cars. But for the PN, switching diesel-powered buses to electric ones would have been a crucial initiative to reduce emissions and combat climate change. \"Since these buses operate throughout the day on our roads, they should be the first priority in the electrification of Malta's vehicle fleet. \"Instead, Robert Abela made the meaningless decision to withdraw the allocation of these funds, leaving diesel buses on the roads while redirecting funds to more private cars, worsening traffic. This comes after the government reduced the grant for private electric cars in the recent budget from €11,000 to €8,000.\" Spokespeople Mark Anthony Sammut, Ryan Callus, and Eve Borg Bonello told the media on Monday that the decision to withdraw from the €34 million agreement with the European Commission would also result in the loss of €7 million in EU funds for charging stations and another €50 million in private investment for cleaner air. \"This reckless decision by Abela confirms his lack of direction and how quality is discarded with every decision he makes. \"If he really needed to cut funds, Abela should have reduced wasteful spending on core government insiders and the corruption that has engulfed his administration,\" they said, adding that quality of life depended on clean air. They added that due to PL's incompetence, people's health will continue to suffer from the exhaust fumes of diesel-powered buses passing past pedestrians. \"The PN is the only solution for the Maltese people. We promise electrified mass transport that will not only reduce emissions on our roads but also provide an efficient and adequate service. \"Above all, we promise accountability and seriousness in public spending and in the use of European funds in the interest of the common good, not just for the privileged few.\" PL reacts Reacting to the PN's press conference, the PL said in a statement the Opposition's true colours were revealed on Monday morning. \"Under a Nationalist government, the thousands of grants given for a person to switch from traditional fuel to electrification of a vehicle will no longer be given,\" the PL claimed. The party said that a Labour government will, on the other hand, continue providing incentives to those who opt for an electric vehicle. The incentives will not just apply to the purchase of a car but also when it comes to the registration and circulation tax relief from the road licence. \"Strong initiatives for those who make the choice to go for a private vehicle, with the least possible environmental damage.\" That is the difference between austerity measures and incentivising people.  \n",

Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.  \n",

The first incident occurred in Mellieħa at around 5.30pm, when the 17-year-old was hit by a Jeep Grand Cherokee on Triq il-Marfa. The Jeep, driven by a 52-year-old Żejtun man, smashed into a parked Honda Civic as a result of the incident. The teenage victim was given first aid on site and rushed to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance to be treated for her serious injuries. Two hours later, police were busy responding to another serious incident in Gudja. A man was fixing a punctured tyre on a Ford Fiesta that stopped on Dawret il-Gudja at around 7.45pm when he was hit by a Skoda Fabia driven by a 50-year-old Gudja resident. The victim, a 29-year-old from Birżebbuġa, ended up squashed between the two vehicles and was seriously injured as a result. He was given first aid and taken to Mater Dei Hospital by ambulance, where he is receiving treatment. Magistrate Ian Farrugia is leading two separate inquiries into the two traffic incidents. Police have also launched their own investigations into the incidents.  \n",

The sixth and final steel piece measures 18 metres in length and weighs around 25.5 tonnes. “The flyover will allow us to create a new open space in the heart of Msida, while we will also be constructing a canal to help alleviate the flooding problem that is synonymous with this area,” Bonett said.  The Transport Minister said the project progressed at a fast pace, adding that a new bridge connecting Msida to Pietà will open to traffic in the coming weeks. Infrastructure Malta CEO Steve Ellul explained that the works on this project are being carried out in a way that minimises inconvenience as much as possible — both for residents and for those who travel through the area by car. “Major works that require traffic diversions are being carried out during weekends or at night, with clear communication in advance to ensure the project’s successful implementation,” Ellul said.  \n",

Times of Malta leads with survey data showing that traffic, parking and public transport-related issues are now Malta’s biggest headache, and by a large margin.

New poll data published by Times of Malta suggests frustration with traffic-related issues has reached new heights, with people citing them as both the country’s biggest problem as well as the biggest hassle in their own personal lives.  And while irregular migration numbers are at record lows, many still cited 'asylum seekers' as the country's biggest problem. When coupled with mentions of 'illegal immigration', the issue ranks among the top concerns for people both on a national and individual level, cutting across party lines.  Concerns about corruption, which in previous years were regularly cited as a major national issue, appear to have waned and people are now more likely to cite the environment as a major issue  Senior citizens, on the other hand, appear to be the most satisfied citizens of all: 22.1 per cent were unable to name a single biggest problem impacting their life at the moment.  \n",
       "319  A court has sharply criticised the police and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not working together to properly establish the facts which led to the death of young worker Matthew Bartolo in the accident at Constructure Furniture 10 years ago. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit made her comments as Construct Furniture director John Agius, floor manager Amanda Cefai and foreman James Cefai were acquitted of involuntary homicide. Agius was convicted of having engaged Bartolo without undertaking a risk assessment and fined €7,000.  All the accused were acquitted of failing to keep proper records, perjury, suppressing the evidence of a crime, and providing false information to the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA). Agius was also acquitted of recidivism.  The court in its considerations said that the prosecution in such cases needed to prove that there was a link between an alleged shortcoming by the accused and the employee, and that their acts of commission or omission caused the fatal incident. While Agius was the director of the company which engaged Bartolo on January 12, 2025, there was no evidence that Bartolo was employed by the Cefais. All that transpired from the evidence was that they were both at the factory when the fatal incident occurred. A court-appointed expert had reported that the machine did not have any issues. In its judgement, the court said it did not understand how the prosecution did not consider the conclusions of the court-appointed expert, and did not take criminal action against Nick Bellizzi, the engineer who certified the machine in 2012, and who should have carried out a risk assessment of the full machine.  It was clear that Bellizzi was responsible for the health and safety of the machinery, with the prosecution having failed to show whether Construct Furniture had a health and safety officer. From the evidence it emerged that Agius was working on the basis of instructions issued by Bellizzi. Had there been any shortcomings, the accused was not alerted to them by the engineer.  The court also noted that Agius had installed a safety barrier to the machine out of his own will, showing that he was “serious” in his work, contrary to Bellizzi.  It therefore acquitted all three accused of the main charge of involuntary homicide. It also acquitted the Cefais of the charges related to health and safety, finding that there was no contractual link between them and the victim. With regards to Agius, the court said the situation was different since there was an employment contract. While Agius made use of Bellizzi’s services, he was not exonerated from his own duties. During the proceedings no documents were presented to show that Bartolo had undergone medical tests before being employed. It also emerged that the instructions on how to use the machine were not observed prior to the incident, with the court referring to the conclusions of a technical expert. In his testimony, Agius had said that Bartolo could have sought to place the wood on the machine in a better manner. Instead of stopping the machine altogether, he had jumped over the barrier and slipped.  On the basis of the available instructions to workers, the court ruled that Agius had done his utmost to ensure a safe working environment. Blundell should have been answerable to the shortcomings and not Agius, the court said. Agius was found guilty of employing Bartolo without a prior risk assessment  and without ensuring that he was assigned adequate work. The trio were acquitted of forging Bartolo’s signature on the employment contract, with the court noting that the court-appointed expert was never asked to carry out a comparative exercise on Bartolo’s signatures. Nor had the prosecution proven that the accused were making use of a fake employment contract. Agius was also not found guilty of recidivism after the prosecution did not present the judgement by which he had been found guilty earlier. This was the second prosecution in connection with the case. In 2023 David Peter Blundell, 50, who had been working alongside the 17-year old, was acquitted of failing to take all necessary health and safety measures during the operation of the machine. He was cleared of responsibility for the death. The court in its latest sentence rapped the prosecution and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not having worked together in the investigations of this case to establish what happened that led to Bartolo’s death. Despite so many years having passed, the court said it still did not have a clear picture of the unfortunate accident that led to the loss of life of someone just started out in life. “This court hopes that nowadays the two entities are working effectively together and for the benefit of society,” the court said. Agius was fined €7,000 and acquitted of the other charges. The Cefais were acquitted of all the charges. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit presided. Police superintendent Hubert Cini and inspector Joseph Mercieca prosecuted. Lawyers Veronique Dalli, Edward Gatt and Pio Valletta appeared for the accused.

British tourist, Liam Joseph Stacey, was charged in July accused of causing grievous bodily harm during a brawl involving a group of allegedly drunk and aggressive Maltese patrons at the hotel. During the proceedings, it had emerged that the scene unfolded after Stacey was slapped in the face by one of the Maltese men, causing him to fall over his toddler. Stacey got up and allegedly punched the man, later identified as Roderick Sciortino, in retaliation.  The only visible mark was a small bruise on the back of Sciortino’s head, which was unrelated to the brain bleed and likely sustained when he fell. A consultant neurosurgeon confirmed that scans revealed a ruptured aneurysm -  a weakened arterial wall - that was not trauma-related. “It was a purely pathological bleed, not due to an injury,” Scerri said. He added that Sciortino’s blood pressure was recorded at 200, high enough to rupture an artery, and his alcohol levels were elevated. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech presided. The prosecution was led by AG lawyer Brandon Bonnici, assisted by police inspectors Bradley Grima and Clayton Camilleri. Lawyer Stefano Filletti assisted the accused.

       "      <td>A motorist claims his car mirror was shattered by a speeding LESA vehicle that failed to stop after hitting his car while he was stuck in traffic. Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>The PN on Monday slammed the government for diverting EU funds that were meant to be used to electrify Malta’s public transport to fund subsidies for electric private cars. By encouraging the use of private cars, the government would make the traffic situation on the island even worse, three party spokespeople told a press conference at the Marsa park-and-ride on Monday. Last week, the PN revealed that the government had \"secretly\" withdrawn plans to receive over €40 million in EU funding to spend on updating Malta’s bus fleet. As a result, the private company that runs the public transport system said its plans to electrify Malta’s bus fleet “cannot go ahead”. In reply to questions by Times of Malta, Prime Minister Robert Abela confirmed the funds that were going to be used for the project will instead go to people to electrify their private cars. But for the PN, switching diesel-powered buses to electric ones would have been a crucial initiative to reduce emissions and combat climate change. \"Since these buses operate throughout the day on our roads, they should be the first priority in the electrification of Malta's vehicle fleet. \"Instead, Robert Abela made the meaningless decision to withdraw the allocation of these funds, leaving diesel buses on the roads while redirecting funds to more private cars, worsening traffic. This comes after the government reduced the grant for private electric cars in the recent budget from €11,000 to €8,000.\" Spokespeople Mark Anthony Sammut, Ryan Callus, and Eve Borg Bonello told the media on Monday that the decision to withdraw from the €34 million agreement with the European Commission would also result in the loss of €7 million in EU funds for charging stations and another €50 million in private investment for cleaner air. \"This reckless decision by Abela confirms his lack of direction and how quality is discarded with every decision he makes. \"If he really needed to cut funds, Abela should have reduced wasteful spending on core government insiders and the corruption that has engulfed his administration,\" they said, adding that quality of life depended on clean air. They added that due to PL's incompetence, people's health will continue to suffer from the exhaust fumes of diesel-powered buses passing past pedestrians. \"The PN is the only solution for the Maltese people. We promise electrified mass transport that will not only reduce emissions on our roads but also provide an efficient and adequate service. \"Above all, we promise accountability and seriousness in public spending and in the use of European funds in the interest of the common good, not just for the privileged few.\" PL reacts Reacting to the PN's press conference, the PL said in a statement the Opposition's true colours were revealed on Monday morning. \"Under a Nationalist government, the thousands of grants given for a person to switch from traditional fuel to electrification of a vehicle will no longer be given,\" the PL claimed. The party said that a Labour government will, on the other hand, continue providing incentives to those who opt for an electric vehicle. The incentives will not just apply to the purchase of a car but also when it comes to the registration and circulation tax relief from the road licence. \"Strong initiatives for those who make the choice to go for a private vehicle, with the least possible environmental damage.\" That is the difference between austerity measures and incentivising people.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A private contractor who placed a skip on St Paul's Bay bypass that was involved in a serious road accident on Wednesday did not have a permit, local authorities say.  The mayor of St Paul’s Bay, Infrastructure Malta, and Transport Malta all said they did not grant permission for the unnamed contractor to place a skip on the road on Wednesday.  A 54-year-old motorcyclist was seriously injured when he crashed into the stationary garbage skip left on a blind bend along the bypass.  Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.</td>\n",

The first incident occurred in Mellieħa at around 5.30pm, when the 17-year-old was hit by a Jeep Grand Cherokee on Triq il-Marfa. The Jeep, driven by a 52-year-old Żejtun man, smashed into a parked Honda Civic as a result of the incident.

       "      <td>The Msida flyover will open by the end of the year, Transport Minister Chris Bonett said, as the last steel structure forming the flyover at Msida Creek was installed on Sunday morning. The sixth and final steel piece measures 18 metres in length and weighs around 25.5 tonnes. “The flyover will allow us to create a new open space in the heart of Msida, while we will also be constructing a canal to help alleviate the flooding problem that is synonymous with this area,” Bonett said.  The Transport Minister said the project progressed at a fast pace, adding that a new bridge connecting Msida to Pietà will open to traffic in the coming weeks. Infrastructure Malta CEO Steve Ellul explained that the works on this project are being carried out in a way that minimises inconvenience as much as possible — both for residents and for those who travel through the area by car. “Major works that require traffic diversions are being carried out during weekends or at night, with clear communication in advance to ensure the project’s successful implementation,” Ellul said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Traffic, parking and public transport-related issues are now Malta’s biggest headache, and by a large margin. New poll data published by Times of Malta suggests frustration with traffic-related issues has reached new heights, with people citing them as both the country’s biggest problem as well as the biggest hassle in their own personal lives.  And while irregular migration numbers are at record lows, many still cited 'asylum seekers' as the country's biggest problem. When coupled with mentions of 'illegal immigration', the issue ranks among the top concerns for people both on a national and individual level, cutting across party lines.  Concerns about corruption, which in previous years were regularly cited as a major national issue, appear to have waned and people are now more likely to cite the environment as a major issue  Senior citizens, on the other hand, appear to be the most satisfied citizens of all: 22.1 per cent were unable to name a single biggest problem impacting their life at the moment.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A court has sharply criticised the police and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not working together to properly establish the facts which led to the death of young worker Matthew Bartolo in the accident at Constructure Furniture 10 years ago. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit made her comments as Construct Furniture director John Agius, floor manager Amanda Cefai and foreman James Cefai were acquitted of involuntary homicide. Agius was convicted of having engaged Bartolo without undertaking a risk assessment and fined €7,000.  All the accused were acquitted of failing to keep proper records, perjury, suppressing the evidence of a crime, and providing false information to the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA). Agius was also acquitted of recidivism.  The court in its considerations said that the prosecution in such cases needed to prove that there was a link between an alleged shortcoming by the accused and the employee, and that their acts of commission or omission caused the fatal incident. While Agius was the director of the company which engaged Bartolo on January 12, 2025, there was no evidence that Bartolo was employed by the Cefais. All that transpired from the evidence was that they were both at the factory when the fatal incident occurred. A court-appointed expert had reported that the machine did not have any issues. In its judgement, the court said it did not understand how the prosecution did not consider the conclusions of the court-appointed expert, and did not take criminal action against Nick Bellizzi, the engineer who certified the machine in 2012, and who should have carried out a risk assessment of the full machine.  It was clear that Bellizzi was responsible for the health and safety of the machinery, with the prosecution having failed to show whether Construct Furniture had a health and safety officer. From the evidence it emerged that Agius was working on the basis of instructions issued by Bellizzi. Had there been any shortcomings, the accused was not alerted to them by the engineer.  The court also noted that Agius had installed a safety barrier to the machine out of his own will, showing that he was “serious” in his work, contrary to Bellizzi.  It therefore acquitted all three accused of the main charge of involuntary homicide. It also acquitted the Cefais of the charges related to health and safety, finding that there was no contractual link between them and the victim. With regards to Agius, the court said the situation was different since there was an employment contract. While Agius made use of Bellizzi’s services, he was not exonerated from his own duties. During the proceedings no documents were presented to show that Bartolo had undergone medical tests before being employed. It also emerged that the instructions on how to use the machine were not observed prior to the incident, with the court referring to the conclusions of a technical expert. In his testimony, Agius had said that Bartolo could have sought to place the wood on the machine in a better manner. Instead of stopping the machine altogether, he had jumped over the barrier and slipped.  On the basis of the available instructions to workers, the court ruled that Agius had done his utmost to ensure a safe working environment. Blundell should have been answerable to the shortcomings and not Agius, the court said. Agius was found guilty of employing Bartolo without a prior risk assessment  and without ensuring that he was assigned adequate work. The trio were acquitted of forging Bartolo’s signature on the employment contract, with the court noting that the court-appointed expert was never asked to carry out a comparative exercise on Bartolo’s signatures. Nor had the prosecution proven that the accused were making use of a fake employment contract. Agius was also not found guilty of recidivism after the prosecution did not present the judgement by which he had been found guilty earlier. This was the second prosecution in connection with the case. In 2023 David Peter Blundell, 50, who had been working alongside the 17-year old, was acquitted of failing to take all necessary health and safety measures during the operation of the machine. He was cleared of responsibility for the death. The court in its latest sentence rapped the prosecution and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not having worked together in the investigations of this case to establish what happened that led to Bartolo’s death. Despite so many years having passed, the court said it still did not have a clear picture of the unfortunate accident that led to the loss of life of someone just started out in life. “This court hopes that nowadays the two entities are working effectively together and for the benefit of society,” the court said. Agius was fined €7,000 and acquitted of the other charges. The Cefais were acquitted of all the charges. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit presided. Police superintendent Hubert Cini and inspector Joseph Mercieca prosecuted. Lawyers Veronique Dalli, Edward Gatt and Pio Valletta appeared for the accused. Lawyer Jason Azzopard, Kris Busietta and Alessandro Farrugia appeared for Bartolo’s family. Family members disappointed and frustrated Following the court's decisions members of the victim's family expressed frustration and disappointment by the outcome.   They said the outcome was unfair and much more could have been done int he 10 years since the tragedy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A man was acquitted on Wednesday morning in connection with the poolside brawl at Seabank Hotel. British tourist, Liam Joseph Stacey, was charged in July accused of causing grievous bodily harm during a brawl involving a group of allegedly drunk and aggressive Maltese patrons at the hotel. During the proceedings, it had emerged that the scene unfolded after Stacey was slapped in the face by one of the Maltese men, causing him to fall over his toddler. Stacey got up and allegedly punched the man, later identified as Roderick Sciortino, in retaliation.  The only visible mark was a small bruise on the back of Sciortino’s head, which was unrelated to the brain bleed and likely sustained when he fell. A consultant neurosurgeon confirmed that scans revealed a ruptured aneurysm -  a weakened arterial wall - that was not trauma-related. “It was a purely pathological bleed, not due to an injury,” Scerri said. He added that Sciortino’s blood pressure was recorded at 200, high enough to rupture an artery, and his alcohol levels were elevated. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech presided. The prosecution was led by AG lawyer Brandon Bonnici, assisted by police inspectors Bradley Grima and Clayton Camilleri. Lawyer Stefano Filletti assisted the accused. Lawyer Rachel Tua appeared for Sciortino’s family. More to follow</td>\n",

Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"  \n",

By encouraging the use of private cars, the government would make the traffic situation on the island even worse, three party spokespeople told a press conference at the Marsa park-and-ride on Monday. Last week, the PN revealed that the government had \"secretly\" withdrawn plans to receive over €40 million in EU funding to spend on updating Malta’s bus fleet. As a result, the private company that runs the public transport system said its plans to electrify Malta’s bus fleet “cannot go ahead”. In reply to questions by Times of Malta, Prime Minister Robert Abela confirmed the funds that were going to be used for the project will instead go to people to electrify their private cars. But for the PN, switching diesel-powered buses to electric ones would have been a crucial initiative to reduce emissions and combat climate change. \"Since these buses operate throughout the day on our roads, they should be the first priority in the electrification of Malta's vehicle fleet. \"Instead, Robert Abela made the meaningless decision to withdraw the allocation of these funds, leaving diesel buses on the roads while redirecting funds to more private cars, worsening traffic. This comes after the government reduced the grant for private electric cars in the recent budget from €11,000 to €8,000.\" Spokespeople Mark Anthony Sammut, Ryan Callus, and Eve Borg Bonello told the media on Monday that the decision to withdraw from the €34 million agreement with the European Commission would also result in the loss of €7 million in EU funds for charging stations and another €50 million in private investment for cleaner air. \"This reckless decision by Abela confirms his lack of direction and how quality is discarded with every decision he makes. \"If he really needed to cut funds, Abela should have reduced wasteful spending on core government insiders and the corruption that has engulfed his administration,\" they said, adding that quality of life depended on clean air. They added that due to PL's incompetence, people's health will continue to suffer from the exhaust fumes of diesel-powered buses passing past pedestrians. \"The PN is the only solution for the Maltese people. We promise electrified mass transport that will not only reduce emissions on our roads but also provide an efficient and adequate service. \"Above all, we promise accountability and seriousness in public spending and in the use of European funds in the interest of the common good, not just for the privileged few.\" PL reacts Reacting to the PN's press conference, the PL said in a statement the Opposition's true colours were revealed on Monday morning. \"Under a Nationalist government, the thousands of grants given for a person to switch from traditional fuel to electrification of a vehicle will no longer be given,\" the PL claimed. The party said that a Labour government will, on the other hand, continue providing incentives to those who opt for an electric vehicle. The incentives will not just apply to the purchase of a car but also when it comes to the registration and circulation tax relief from the road licence. \"Strong initiatives for those who make the choice to go for a private vehicle, with the least possible environmental damage.\" That is the difference between austerity measures and incentivising people.  \n",

Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.  \n",

The sixth and final steel piece measures 18 metres in length and weighs around 25.5 tonnes. “The flyover will allow us to create a new open space in the heart of Msida, while we will also be constructing a canal to help alleviate the flooding problem that is synonymous with this area,” Bonett said.  The Transport Minister said the project progressed at a fast pace, adding that a new bridge connecting Msida to Pietà will open to traffic in the coming weeks. Infrastructure Malta CEO Steve Ellul explained that the works on this project are being carried out in a way that minimises inconvenience as much as possible — both for residents and for those who travel through the area by car. “Major works that require traffic diversions are being carried out during weekends or at night, with clear communication in advance to ensure the project’s successful implementation,” Ellul said.  \n",

Times of Malta leads with survey data showing that traffic, parking and public transport-related issues are now Malta’s biggest headache, and by a large margin.

New poll data published by Times of Malta suggests frustration with traffic-related issues has reached new heights, with people citing them as both the country’s biggest problem as well as the biggest hassle in their own personal lives.  And while irregular migration numbers are at record lows, many still cited 'asylum seekers' as the country's biggest problem. When coupled with mentions of 'illegal immigration', the issue ranks among the top concerns for people both on a national and individual level, cutting across party lines.  Concerns about corruption, which in previous years were regularly cited as a major national issue, appear to have waned and people are now more likely to cite the environment as a major issue  Senior citizens, on the other hand, appear to be the most satisfied citizens of all: 22.1 per cent were unable to name a single biggest problem impacting their life at the moment.  \n",
       "319  A court has sharply criticised the police and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not working together to properly establish the facts which led to the death of young worker Matthew Bartolo in the accident at Constructure Furniture 10 years ago. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit made her comments as Construct Furniture director John Agius, floor manager Amanda Cefai and foreman James Cefai were acquitted of involuntary homicide. Agius was convicted of having engaged Bartolo without undertaking a risk assessment and fined €7,000.  All the accused were acquitted of failing to keep proper records, perjury, suppressing the evidence of a crime, and providing false information to the Occupational Health and Safety Authority (OHSA). Agius was also acquitted of recidivism.  The court in its considerations said that the prosecution in such cases needed to prove that there was a link between an alleged shortcoming by the accused and the employee, and that their acts of commission or omission caused the fatal incident. While Agius was the director of the company which engaged Bartolo on January 12, 2025, there was no evidence that Bartolo was employed by the Cefais. All that transpired from the evidence was that they were both at the factory when the fatal incident occurred. A court-appointed expert had reported that the machine did not have any issues. In its judgement, the court said it did not understand how the prosecution did not consider the conclusions of the court-appointed expert, and did not take criminal action against Nick Bellizzi, the engineer who certified the machine in 2012, and who should have carried out a risk assessment of the full machine.  It was clear that Bellizzi was responsible for the health and safety of the machinery, with the prosecution having failed to show whether Construct Furniture had a health and safety officer. From the evidence it emerged that Agius was working on the basis of instructions issued by Bellizzi. Had there been any shortcomings, the accused was not alerted to them by the engineer.  The court also noted that Agius had installed a safety barrier to the machine out of his own will, showing that he was “serious” in his work, contrary to Bellizzi.  It therefore acquitted all three accused of the main charge of involuntary homicide. It also acquitted the Cefais of the charges related to health and safety, finding that there was no contractual link between them and the victim. With regards to Agius, the court said the situation was different since there was an employment contract. While Agius made use of Bellizzi’s services, he was not exonerated from his own duties. During the proceedings no documents were presented to show that Bartolo had undergone medical tests before being employed. It also emerged that the instructions on how to use the machine were not observed prior to the incident, with the court referring to the conclusions of a technical expert. In his testimony, Agius had said that Bartolo could have sought to place the wood on the machine in a better manner. Instead of stopping the machine altogether, he had jumped over the barrier and slipped.  On the basis of the available instructions to workers, the court ruled that Agius had done his utmost to ensure a safe working environment. Blundell should have been answerable to the shortcomings and not Agius, the court said. Agius was found guilty of employing Bartolo without a prior risk assessment  and without ensuring that he was assigned adequate work. The trio were acquitted of forging Bartolo’s signature on the employment contract, with the court noting that the court-appointed expert was never asked to carry out a comparative exercise on Bartolo’s signatures. Nor had the prosecution proven that the accused were making use of a fake employment contract. Agius was also not found guilty of recidivism after the prosecution did not present the judgement by which he had been found guilty earlier. This was the second prosecution in connection with the case. In 2023 David Peter Blundell, 50, who had been working alongside the 17-year old, was acquitted of failing to take all necessary health and safety measures during the operation of the machine. He was cleared of responsibility for the death. The court in its latest sentence rapped the prosecution and the Occupational Health and Safety Authority for not having worked together in the investigations of this case to establish what happened that led to Bartolo’s death. Despite so many years having passed, the court said it still did not have a clear picture of the unfortunate accident that led to the loss of life of someone just started out in life. “This court hopes that nowadays the two entities are working effectively together and for the benefit of society,” the court said. Agius was fined €7,000 and acquitted of the other charges. The Cefais were acquitted of all the charges. Magistrate Claire Stafrace Zammit presided. Police superintendent Hubert Cini and inspector Joseph Mercieca prosecuted. Lawyers Veronique Dalli, Edward Gatt and Pio Valletta appeared for the accused.

British tourist, Liam Joseph Stacey, was charged in July accused of causing grievous bodily harm during a brawl involving a group of allegedly drunk and aggressive Maltese patrons at the hotel. During the proceedings, it had emerged that the scene unfolded after Stacey was slapped in the face by one of the Maltese men, causing him to fall over his toddler. Stacey got up and allegedly punched the man, later identified as Roderick Sciortino, in retaliation.  The only visible mark was a small bruise on the back of Sciortino’s head, which was unrelated to the brain bleed and likely sustained when he fell. A consultant neurosurgeon confirmed that scans revealed a ruptured aneurysm -  a weakened arterial wall - that was not trauma-related. “It was a purely pathological bleed, not due to an injury,” Scerri said. He added that Sciortino’s blood pressure was recorded at 200, high enough to rupture an artery, and his alcohol levels were elevated. Magistrate Donatella Frendo Dimech presided. The prosecution was led by AG lawyer Brandon Bonnici, assisted by police inspectors Bradley Grima and Clayton Camilleri. Lawyer Stefano Filletti assisted the accused. Lawyer Rachel Tua appeared for Sciortino’s family. More to follow  \n",

Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"</td>\n",

Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.</td>\n",

Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.</td>\n",

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported.

On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.</td>\n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said.

Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"   \n",

Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout.

Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.   \n",
       "309  The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.   \n",

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.   \n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",

       "      <td>A crowdfunding campaign for a nurse left in a coma after a car crash that killed her unborn baby has raised more than €70,000 in two days. Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.</td>\n",

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.</td>\n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.   \n",
       "286  The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.   \n",

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.   \n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",

       "      <td>A crowdfunding campaign for a nurse left in a coma after a car crash that killed her unborn baby has raised more than €70,000 in two days. Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.</td>\n",

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.</td>\n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.   \n",
       "286  The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.   \n",

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.   \n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",

       "      <td>A crowdfunding campaign for a nurse left in a coma after a car crash that killed her unborn baby has raised more than €70,000 in two days. Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.</td>\n",

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.</td>\n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.   \n",
       "286  The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.   \n",

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.   \n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",

       "      <td>A motorist claims his car mirror was shattered by a speeding LESA vehicle that failed to stop after hitting his car while he was stuck in traffic. Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>A private contractor who placed a skip on St Paul's Bay bypass that was involved in a serious road accident on Wednesday did not have a permit, local authorities say.  The mayor of St Paul’s Bay, Infrastructure Malta, and Transport Malta all said they did not grant permission for the unnamed contractor to place a skip on the road on Wednesday.  A 54-year-old motorcyclist was seriously injured when he crashed into the stationary garbage skip left on a blind bend along the bypass.  Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A crowdfunding campaign for a nurse left in a coma after a car crash that killed her unborn baby has raised more than €70,000 in two days. Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.</td>\n",

A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.</td>\n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said.

Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"   \n",

Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout.

Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.   \n",
       "286  The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.   \n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said.

       "      <td>A motorist claims his car mirror was shattered by a speeding LESA vehicle that failed to stop after hitting his car while he was stuck in traffic. Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"</td>\n",

       "      <td>A private contractor who placed a skip on St Paul's Bay bypass that was involved in a serious road accident on Wednesday did not have a permit, local authorities say.  The mayor of St Paul’s Bay, Infrastructure Malta, and Transport Malta all said they did not grant permission for the unnamed contractor to place a skip on the road on Wednesday.  A 54-year-old motorcyclist was seriously injured when he crashed into the stationary garbage skip left on a blind bend along the bypass.  Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A crowdfunding campaign for a nurse left in a coma after a car crash that killed her unborn baby has raised more than €70,000 in two days. Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A Polish man has died after getting into difficulty while swimming at Ramla Bay in Gozo, police have confirmed.  The incident happened at around 1pm and it is understood the 43-year-old was treated at the scene but was later pronounced dead.  Magistrate Brigitte Sultana is holding an inquiry.   The death is the 15th drowning incident since the start of 2025.  Among the fatalities were a 43-year-old Briton who died in September while swimming at the Blue Lagoon in Comino. A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"   \n",

Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout.

Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.   \n",
       "286  The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.   \n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said.

       "      <td>A motorist claims his car mirror was shattered by a speeding LESA vehicle that failed to stop after hitting his car while he was stuck in traffic. Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"</td>\n",

Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout. According to the police, the injured motorcyclist, an English man from Mellieħa, lost control of his Honda and collided with the skip. He remains in Mater Dei Hospital with serious injuries. While traffic cones and a bollard were at the site, an eyewitness and social media users described these safety features as insufficient.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A crowdfunding campaign for a nurse left in a coma after a car crash that killed her unborn baby has raised more than €70,000 in two days. Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A Polish man has died after getting into difficulty while swimming at Ramla Bay in Gozo, police have confirmed.  The incident happened at around 1pm and it is understood the 43-year-old was treated at the scene but was later pronounced dead.  Magistrate Brigitte Sultana is holding an inquiry.   The death is the 15th drowning incident since the start of 2025.  Among the fatalities were a 43-year-old Briton who died in September while swimming at the Blue Lagoon in Comino. A month earlier, an Italian man also died after getting into difficulty at the same location.  Two drownings occurred in July. A 67-year old from Munxar was found unconscious in the sea at Xlendi, while on the same day a 25-year old Nepalese man also died at Exiles in Sliema.  Several diving accidents were also reported. Dione Galdes, an experienced instructor, died on July 1 after experiencing difficulties during a dive in Ċirkewwa three days prior.  A 54-year-old German diver also died in September, while another diver was reported missing in May.   Two children died of drowning in swimming pools within the space of a few weeks. On June 22, a six-year-old child drowned in a Naxxar swimming pool on after wandering away from his relatives.  And on July 26, 16-month-old Noah Mizzi died after falling into a pool at a residence on Triq in Xagħra.   According to police figures, 14 people died by drowning in 2024, up from seven in 2023.   More to follow.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

Frank Xerri De Caro, 78, was driving his Toyota Yaris home after a meeting on Wednesday around 5pm when the accident occurred on the Regional Road, near the St Julian’s tunnels. Heavy traffic had brought vehicles to a near standstill, leaving little room for manoeuvring. As he approached the tunnels next to St Clare’s Convent, Xerri De Caro said he noticed what he then believed to be a police car with sirens blaring in the distance. Attempting to give way, he moved his car closer to the side of the road. “I could tell the car was coming quite close to me but I couldn’t move anymore as I didn’t have more space to,” he explained. Moments later, he said a speeding LESA vehicle struck his right-hand side mirror, shattering it into pieces on the ground. Xerri De Caro described feeling both shocked and frustrated, notably when the car continued without stopping to assess the situation. “I was shocked at that moment but more so frustrated afterwards,” he said, explaining that he had to spend €300 to repair the damage. Xerri De Caro, who shared his experience on social media, initially said his mirror was destroyed by a police car. After filing a police report and speaking with the police on Thursday morning, he noticed he made a mistake and said that it had been a LESA car that hit his mirror.  He took to social media once again to praise the police for their efficient work and thanked them for their assistance.  LESA responded to the matter in question by saying, \"LESA has received no communication regarding this matter from the injured party prior to this media question.\" They continued, \" LESA invites the injured party to provide all relevant information so that the necessary checks can be made, in accordance with the usual procedure.\"   \n",

Transport Malta said it \"was not informed about the works, and the contractor did not hold a valid permit to carry out works at the site where the accident occurred.\"  Similarly, Infrastructure Malta said it \"had not been notified about the works, and no permission was requested for them.\" However, it acknowledged that the accident occurred near works being carried out by a private contractor under its administration. It did not name the contractor involved. In October, Infrastructure Malta began work to replace a dangerous leaning wall along the same bypass section where the accident happened. St Paul’s Bay Mayor, Censu Galea, also confirmed that the council had not issued any permits. \"No permits were ever issued as far as I am informed,\" he said. He said he was told the skip was placed on the road at around 1pm on Wednesday. The incident was reported to the police at around 5pm.  The mayor noted that the same skip had been in the same location two to three months ago, and people raised safety concerns with the council at the time. He explained that once he was informed, the council alerted Infrastructure Malta, which added cones and bollards at that time. The skip involved in Wednesday’s accident was left at the final curve leading to the Xemxija roundabout.

Tonamol Baby, 28, was five months pregnant when she was struck by a car while crossing the road to start her shift as a nurse at Mount Carmel Hospital on July 16. She lost her baby and has been in hospital ever since, while her 34-year-old husband Tom Jacob spends his days by her side, far from their home in Kerala, India. Tom turned to Times of Malta to share the couple’s story as he set up a crowdfunding campaign for an air ambulance to take her home.  The cost of the medical flight is around €20,000 and the hospital costs would be at least another €30,000.  Tom daily arrives at the neurosurgical ward at Mater Dei Hospital at 8am to sit by the bedside of his wife of three years, staying until he leaves for work at 6pm. He is employed as a sommelier with the db Group. He thanked everyone who contributed, including the db Group and “the db family”, the Healthmark team (Tona’s employers), the Kerala federations and Tonamol’s friends. “Words cannot fully express our gratitude. To each and every person who contributed, shared our story, or kept us in their thoughts, thank you from the bottom of our hearts. “Your kindness has given us hope and strength during one of the most difficult times of our lives. We assure you that all of you will be remembered in our prayers always. And we kindly ask you to continue keeping us in yours, more than anything, we need your prayers,” he said. On the day of the accident, Tom was having a cup of tea at the couple’s home in Buġibba when a friend called him with the news about his wife’s accident.  As she crossed the road, a car struck her right pelvic bone and, as she fell to the ground, her head hit a bollard. When Tom arrived at the hospital, he did not recognise his wife at first. Since then, however, he has seen an improvement and hopes she can recover at home in Kerala, surrounded by family. “I will be with her for a couple of months. Then, I hope, she will be okay and I will bring her back with me,” Tom said.   \n",
       "286  The families of the two couples killed in a horrific road crash in Croatia are preparing to bring their loved ones home on Friday. Jeremy and Lorraine Gambin and their best friends Kevin and Sandra Bonnici were killed last Thursday when their Land Rover Discovery plunged off a cliff and veered into the sea on the D8 state road near Bunica, just south of Senj. The funeral of the Gambin couple will be held on Saturday at Balluta church at 9.30am, the victims' son Justin Gambin told Times of Malta. The date of the funeral of the other couple is not yet known.  The four - aged between 66 and 68 - were lifelong friends who regularly holidayed abroad together. In a statement to Times of Malta, the Gambin family said: \"Jeremy and Lorraine, humble and loved by all, lived life to the fullest. They left us doing what they loved most with their best friends.\" Drowning most likely cause of death Meanwhile, autopsy results reported by Croatian media say drowning was the most likely cause of death of the two couples, as only slight injuries were found on the bodies. All four are believed to have been wearing seatbelts. Forensic investigations are ongoing with experts unable to determine what caused the car to veer off the road. Initial reports in the Croatian media that the driver of the vehicle may have become ill while driving, thus leading to the crash, were not verified by the autopsy. The vehicle fell around 70 metres after veering off the road, before crashing into the sea to a depth of at least 11 metres. The investigation was conducted by forensic medicine specialists from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Rijeka. Relatives of the four victims, including their children, laid flowers near the crash site in memory of their loved ones.  Justin Gambin said his father and Kevin Bonnici were “not only cousins but best friends who travelled all over the world together. They’ve driven around together for tens of thousands of kilometres”. Speaking to Times of Malta on Wednesday, he thanked the Croatian police in Senj for their assistance.  Questions on safety of road Meanwhile, questions have been raised about the safety of the D8 road, where certain stretches lack adequate barriers to prevent cars from plunging into the sea below. Jonathan Gambin, whose brother was among the victims, said that while stone bollards along the road “may appear protective, they were likely insufficient to prevent a vehicle from veering off the road”. He had expressed hope that further investigations into the accident would bring the victims’ relatives a measure of closure. It is not known whether the Senj Bora, the notorious strong northeasterly wind that blows along the Adriatic coast of Croatia, could have potentially contributed to the accident. There has also been some speculation in the Croatian media that an oncoming car could also have distracted the Maltese driver.  Croatian emergency divers described the operation to recover the car involved in the crash as one of the most difficult they had ever carried out, with experienced diver Renato Huba telling local media that while he had prepared for the worst, “this was much worse”. A member of the towing service praised a policeman who was among the first to arrive on the scene and who dived into the water in an attempt to open the door of the car damaged by the force of impact. \"He tried everything he could. He jumped, dived, tried to open the door, but due to the extensive damage and the strong water pressure, it was simply not possible. He did his best,\" said Adrian Karamba, 24sata reported.   \n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said.

       "      <td>The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

       "289  The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",

       "      <td>The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

       "289  The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",

One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

       "289  The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",

       "      <td>The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

       "289  The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",

       "      <td>The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

       "289  The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",

       "      <td>The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.</td>\n",

       "289  The Mayor of Għajnsielem on Friday called on the authorities to install speed cameras and traffic calming measures along Triq l-Imġarr after a four-vehicle collision left two people in hospital. One person suffered grievous injuries while another sustained light injuries in the accident, the latest in a string of “serious accidents” along that stretch of road which led mayor Kevin Cauchi to make his heartfelt appeal to the authorities. The accident, which happened around 9am, involved a Mitsubishi L200 driven by a 35-year old man from Xagħra and a Suzuki GSXR driven by a 43-year old man from Nadur. A 19-year old man also from Nadur was riding pillion. A Toyota Corolla driven by a 67-year old man from Qala and an Alfa Romeo driven by a 55-year old man from Munxar were also damaged in the collision. A medical team was called on site and an ambulance took the 43-year old man and the 19-year old youth to the Gozo General Hospital for treatment. Magistrate Brigitte Sultana appointed an inquiry as police investigations continued.  Writing in a social media post following the accident, Għajnsielem mayor Kevin Cauchi expressed his frustration at the lack of inaction following the latest accident on this stretch of road. “Another serious accident took place this morning on Triq l-Imġarr. The statistics speak for themselves yet still nothing is being done,” he said. He pointed out the local council has been appealing with the authority “for years” to install speed cameras, plastic bollards and other traffic calming measures along Triq l- Imġarr and other main roads.   \n",
